The light foam texture is easy to apply and rinses off easily, making my morning routine a breeze. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free, as scented products can often irritate my sensitive skin.After using this product consistently for a few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My pores are less clogged, and my complexion looks brighter and more even.Overall, I highly recommend NIVEA's Refreshing Cleansing Face Wash Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that will leave their skin feeling revitalized and refreshed. It has become a staple in my skincare routine and I will definitely be repurchasing it in the future.\"}, {'product_name': 'NIVEA Face Wash Micellar, Rose Care with Organic Rose, All Skin Types,...', 'review_title': 'Love it', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 15 October 2023', 'review_stars': '5.0', 'review_text': 'Great for everyday use.

The light foam texture is easy to apply and rinses off easily, making my morning routine a breeze. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free, as scented products can often irritate my sensitive skin.After using this product consistently for a few weeks, I have noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance and texture of my skin. My pores are less clogged, and my complexion looks brighter and more even.Overall, I highly recommend NIVEA's Refreshing Cleansing Face Wash Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that will leave their skin feeling revitalized and refreshed.

The light foam texture is easy to apply and rinses off easily, making my morning routine a breeze.

The light foam texture is easy to apply and rinses off easily, making my morning routine a breeze.
